## Overview of Project

Using a database of Kickstarter crowdsourcing data that spanned multiple years and multiple industries, we looked at crowdfunding data specifically for 1047 plays spanning the years 2009-2017 to determine if there were any trends related to funding plays that could be useful in determining the best time of year to attempt a crowdsourcing campaign, and whether the target goal for funding had any influence on determining the success or failure of the crowdsourcing campaign.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

The following chart is based on Kickstarter data spanning the years 2009-2017 specifically for crowdfunding campaigns for plays.  The data suggests that the best time to launch a crowdfunding campaign is in the summer, and the month of May in particular tended to do well.  The likelihood of failure for a crowdsourcing campaign remained nearly steady regardless of the month of the year.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
The following chart shows that crowdsourcing projects for plays with a funding goal greater than 45,000 USD were not likely to reach their goal. Plays with a funding goal up to 15,000 were more likely to succeed than to fail.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
  - The best month to launch a crowdfunding campaign for a play is May.
  - The failure rate stayed relatively constant during the whole year.
  - 
- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
  - The goal ranges most likely to success are target amounts of 10,000 USD or less, or between 35,000 and 40,000 USD
  - Crowndfunding campaigns for more than 50,000 USD are very unlikely to reach their goal perhaps because the target amount is unrealistically high or requires a significant number of donors, or a high average donation. A strategy for how to obtain funding in that range might be to traget a  number of angel investors capable of investing a large amount.

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
  - Instead of Outcome Based on Goals using percentages of success/failure, it would be useful to see the successes and failure counts in a column graph with the success and failure counts side by side.  This chart demostrates that while any crowdfuncting campaign with a goal less than 15,000 USD is more likely to succeed than not, campaigns with a goal between 1,000 to 5,000 USD have the best overall track record in total number of successful campaigns as well as the percentage that were successful.
